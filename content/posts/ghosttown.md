Well, so much for keeping this thing updated. I haven't been up to much, mostly focusing on college. I have changed my major from Aerospace Engineering to Film and Media Studies, which was a big change for me, but I think it is for the better. I wasn't really doing well with engineering.

Anyways, hopefully I will update the site soon than last time, but we will see.

Until next time...
